January 2025.
This work was done by Pechenin Danila (emails: dmpechenin@edu.hse.ru / dpechenin@icloud.com),
a student studying at the HSE University on the Bachelor's Program in Applied Mathematics (2nd year, group "БПМ233").
There are a bunch of test for the library on Linear Algebra, which developed by me.
The tests were written in C++ with GoogleTest library.
